/**
 * Human class.
 * First type of race abailable on the game.
 * 
 * Humans have rule over the kingdom since they had memories... But the ancient rulers
 * wanted their power back. After the great war, Humans had to rebuild all the reign.
 * 
 * The great war changed everything... Old friendships became new enemies, old wealth
 * is now buried six feet underground, old deals are now new war declarations.
 * 
 * Standard race, with standard stats. It's the easiest one but also the
 * most homogeneous race.
