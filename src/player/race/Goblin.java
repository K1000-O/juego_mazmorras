 * Goblin class.
 * Second type of race abailable on the game.
 * 
 * On the past, the goblins made good pair with the humans when they had to recolect 
 * huge extensions of loot. After the great war, they became enemies.
 * 
 * Now, the goblins wander through the kingdom stealing and looting everything they can.
 * 
 * Their little armour let them move with a high speed but makes them very vulnerable
 * to large fights.
